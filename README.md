# 🦀 Rust LLM from Scratch

[![Rust](https://github.com/tekaratzas/RustGPT/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tekaratzas/RustGPT/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec4a4100-b03a-4b3c-a7d6-806ea54ed4ed

A complete **Large Language Model implementation in pure Rust** with no external ML frameworks. Built from the ground up using only `ndarray` for matrix operations.

## 🚀 What This Is

This project demonstrates how to build a transformer-based language model from scratch in Rust, including:
- **Pre-training** on factual text completion
- **Instruction tuning** for conversational AI
- **Interactive chat mode** for testing
- **Full backpropagation** with gradient clipping
- **Modular architecture** with clean separation of concerns

## ❌ What This Isn't

This is not a production grade LLM. It is so far away from the larger models.

This is just a toy project that demonstrates how these models work under the hood.

## 🔍 Key Files to Explore

Start with these two core files to understand the implementation:

- **[`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs)** - Training pipeline, data preparation, and interactive mode
- **[`src/llm.rs`](src/llm.rs)** - Core LLM implementation with forward/backward passes and training logic

## 🏗️ Architecture

The model uses a **transformer-based architecture** with the following components:

```
Input Text → Tokenization → Embeddings → Transformer Blocks → Output Projection → Predictions
```

## 🧪 What The Model Learns

The implementation includes two training phases:

1. **Pre-training**: Learns basic world knowledge from factual statements
   - "The sun rises in the east and sets in the west"
   - "Water flows downhill due to gravity"
   - "Mountains are tall and rocky formations"

2. **Instruction Tuning**: Learns conversational patterns
   - "User: How do mountains form? Assistant: Mountains are formed through tectonic forces..."
   - Handles greetings, explanations, and follow-up questions

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/tekaratzas/RustGPT.git
cd RustGPT
cargo run

# The model will:
# 1. Build vocabulary from training data
# 2. Pre-train on factual statements (100 epochs)
# 3. Instruction-tune on conversational data (100 epochs)
# 4. Enter interactive mode for testing
```

## 🎮 Interactive Mode

After training, test the model interactively:

```
Enter prompt: How do mountains form?
Model output: Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism over long geological time periods

Enter prompt: What causes rain?
Model output: Rain is caused by water vapor in clouds condensing into droplets that become too heavy to remain airborne
```

## 🧮 Technical Implementation

### Model Configuration
- **Vocabulary Size**: Dynamic (built from training data)
- **Embedding Dimension**: 128 (defined by `EMBEDDING_DIM` in `src/lib.rs`)

- **Max Sequence Length**: 80 tokens (defined by `MAX_SEQ_LEN` in `src/lib.rs`)
- **Architecture**: 3 Transformer blocks + embeddings + output projection

### Training Details
- **Optimizer**: Adam with gradient clipping
- **Pre-training LR**: 0.0005 (100 epochs)
- **Instruction Tuning LR**: 0.0001 (100 epochs)
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss
